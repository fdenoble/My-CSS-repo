    <p>Hello, my name is Francesca DeNoble.</p>
    <p>I am 25 years old.</p>
    <p>My email is francescadenoble@hotmail.com.</p>
    <p>I work in Business Marketing for Canada Life.</p>
    <p>My programming skills are thus far limited to HTML and a little bit of CSS. I've used inline CSS for this assignment because it was not specified to use a stylesheet.</p>

<div id="paragraph">
    <p>Here is a small paragraph about myself with a healthy mix of truths and lies. The photo above is a real photo of me, so I feel the need to explain that I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It's a wonderful sport and I recommend everyone try it. 
        It's certainly for every body, but not everybody, if you know what I mean. I own a cat and three dogs. I speak French, Finnish and I'm learning that Elvish language they use in Lord of the Rings. Thought I don't look very tall, I am actually 6 ft.
        This allows me to walk really fast, meaning my short friends are always struggling to catch up. It must be so unfortunate to be short. I wouldn't know. I love podcasts and audiobooks and I hate watching television with subtitles.
        In fact, if I could just not read ever, I would be a happier person. Everywhere I drive is based simply off memory - I do not read street signs. You might ask yourself, how does she travel anywhere new? Well, she doesn't.<br>
        The End.
